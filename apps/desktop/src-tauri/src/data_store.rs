//! Uniform interface for exporting/restoring a persistent store.
//!
//! Each user-data store implements `DataStore` so the backup commands in
//! `commands/data.rs` can serialize every store into one bundle and restore it
//! with `import`. Import is REPLACE semantics — the store is cleared and
//! repopulated from the bundle, preserving record ids.
//!
//! Secrets (credentials/keychain), ephemeral caches (live postings, company
//! briefs), and the transient job-execution log are intentionally NOT stores
//! here and are excluded from backups.
