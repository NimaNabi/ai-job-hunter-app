//! `applicationStatusEvents` — the status history of every
//! [`super::Application`] as its own export-bundle section (#1402).
//!
//! `ApplicationStore`'s own [`DataStore`] impl (`super::backup`) exports only
//! the applications and, on import, seeds one synthetic `"imported"` event per
//! application. On its own that drops the real history on every
//! backup/restore. This section carries the history verbatim so a restore
//! puts it back, and it is the record shape the optional self-hosted sync
//! (ADR-051) diffs: one record per event, never nested inside the
//! application, so history from two devices unions instead of overwriting.
//!
//! A newtype over the SAME store — status history lives in the
//! `status_events` table of the applications database — so `data_import`
//! routes it through its usual `import_into` closure. It is routed AFTER
//! `"applications"`: that import seeds the synthetic events, and this one
//! replaces them with the real history. A bundle without this section (any
//! backup written before it existed) restores exactly as before.
